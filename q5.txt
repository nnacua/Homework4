1. No
2. Yes
3. The answers differ because 'a' is an immutable object since it is an
iteger while 'b' is a mutable object since it is a list. 'a' is passing by
value which means that the value is copied over to someval but there is no
changes since you would need to call the someval variable. However, since
b is a pass by reference you can change the value both inside and outside
the function.
